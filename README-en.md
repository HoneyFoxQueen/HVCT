# Why do I need HVCT?

Your Smart TV may have many features, but it will never match the freedom that a Laptop offers you. And your Laptop, on the other hand, will never have a screen big enough to fully enjoy entertainment comfortably from the couch with friends and family. HVCT (Home Video Cross Tech) takes advantage of the TV’s visual quality and the freedom of a Laptop, without ever having to leave the couch.

How many times have you found yourself in a situation where something you wanted to watch wasn’t available on the Smart TV, and you were forced to make do with a laptop and an HDMI cable? You’ve probably realized that, at that moment, the remote control becomes little more than a decoration. To control the multimedia content, you had to get up (perhaps several times), move the cat that had lovingly fallen asleep on your lap, or, worse yet, leave your comfy spot on the couch where you had just set up an impromptu table with junk food and drinks, because yes, we don’t live on healthy snacks alone.

HVCT was created precisely to solve this hassle. Imagine being able to use your TV remote to control your laptop, without even getting up a single inch. No more running to press play, stop, or skip ahead by 5 seconds. All of this while staying comfortably seated, without ever having to move the cat or the makeshift table.

The HVCT project was created thanks to the [IRremote](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote) library for Arduino, available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/LICENSE)
